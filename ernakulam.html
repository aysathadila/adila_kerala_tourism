        In the island of Bolgatty lies Kochi’s famous Bolgatty Palace. It is one of the oldest existing Dutch palaces in the world. It was built by the Dutch traders in the year 1744 and later was extended and gardens were landscaped around it.

This was at that time the Governor’s palace for the commander of the Dutch Malabar. In the year 1909 it was leased out to the British, hence serving as the home of the British Governors. It was also the seat of the British Resident of Cochin during the British Raj.

    <p>
        Later on in the year 1947, when India attained independence from the British, the palace became the state’s property and then later was converted into a heritage hotel resort. Now this palace has a swimming pool along with a 9 hole golf course and an ayurvedic centre.

There is also daily Kathakali performances making this a perfect place for both Foreign and Indian holidaymakers.

    A landmark tourist attraction of Kochi, Kerala, the Chinese Fishing nets, can be seen on the shores of the backwaters. Not only a fishing accessory, these nets have, now become an integral part of Kochi tourism.

    These Chinese Fishing is believed to have been brought by Zheng, who is a Chinese explorer, from Kubla Khan’s court. It is said to have been set up between 1350 and 1450 AD.

   <p>
    These nets are built using the wood of Teak and also with Bamboo poles, where balance is the key point. Each of these nets go up to a height of 10 meters and has a cantilever of about 20 meters attached to it. The counterweights, which are mainly stones, have a diameter of 30 centimetre. These are tied to different length ropes to help it work. In order to attract fishes, lights are fixed to the teak posts, above the nets.

For the best view of these nets, head out to the Vasco da Gama Square, the narrow and beautiful walkway that goes along the Fort Kochi Beach. This sight has a title of being one of the most photographed sights in Kochi.
