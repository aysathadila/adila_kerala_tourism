        Spread over a cluster of islands, surrounded by beautiful hillocks lies a bird watchers' planet, the Kadalundi Bird Sanctuary. Located in Kozhikode, the sanctuary greets its visitors with freshwaters of Kadalundi River. This virgin land is home to 60 migratory and more than hundred native birds. Wildlife enthusiasts and bird lovers visit the place to capture even the minutest movements of the birds in their cameras. The sanctuary finds itself 200 m above the sea level.

        The paradise designed for bird lovers also offers you a place in serenity. Away from the city's hustle, you can sit here and relax while you witness the lively playful birds. Moreover, the river flowing inside forms a union with the Arabian Sea at a point called Kadalundi Nagaram. This river houses a variety of fishes, crabs, and mussels. You must visit the Kadalundi Bird Sanctuary in December-April when the forest seems no less than a green blanket. It is the time when you can see most of the birds.

        Several famous Hindu temples like Thiruvilwamala Sree Rama Temple, Thirunavaya Navamukunda Temple, Chamravattam Ayyappa Temple and Panniyur Sree Varahamurthy temple lie on its bank. This sacred river is believed to bestow salvation to those who are cremated on its banks, and accordingly sons pay homage to their fathers by performing the "Pithru Tharpanam" ritual on the Karkidaka Vavu day.
