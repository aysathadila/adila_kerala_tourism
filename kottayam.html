        Located at a height of 6000 ft above the sea level in the Western Ghats of Kottayam, Kerala, Illikkal Kallu is a major tourist attraction and one of the most pristine spots in all of India. Situated in Moonnilavu Village, Meenachil taluk, the nearest city to the summit is Teekoy. Besides several other factors which make this peak unique, the most prominent feature is that half the boulder of the majestic rock has fallen apart. The remaining half stands sturdy and presents an extremely exalted picture. Surrounded by colossal green hills, the offbeat destination boasts of immaculate environs, enchanting panoramic vistas and an all around utopian atmosphere. In addition to the surreal natural beauty, the sublime view of the Arabian Sea in the near horizon as a thin blue stroke, is a sight beyond description.

    <p>
       
        One of the highest peaks in the vicinity, Illikkal Kallu comprises of three different hills- each rising to at least 4000 ft above the sea level. Boasting of mystical surroundings, hills imbued with a green blanket and an overall idyllic setting, the destination is blessed with bounteous natural bliss and is still unexploited and untapped by tourism. Above all, the sunset view as seen from the peak is absolutely riveting; the moon rises adjacently as the orange sun goes down. Also, the winding roads leading to the majestic boulders can give an adrenaline rush to all the adventure junkies.
