        Situated in the forest region of Sabarimala in Pathanamthitta district, one of the major pilgrim centres of South India, Perunthenaruvi allures tourists with its breathtakingly beautiful waterfalls and the dazzling stream that flows to merge with the sacred Pamba River. The locality is the home turf of beehives which have bestowed the place with the title Perunthenaruvi meaning the “River of Honey”. 

There is no better place to have a pleasant peaceful time than when you are romancing with nature and surround yourself with its purity to cleanse your soul. Perunthenaruvi offers you just that.

    You can either choose a 5-minute walk or a 20-minute trek through the tea plantations to reach the waterfalls here. The music of the cascades welcomes you even from afar. The hike leads you to a luxuriant waterfall with a luscious swimming hole that tempts one to leap into its deep waters. The stream gushes further beyond through the rocky bed to unite with the holy Pamba. The river Pamba is attributed with divine grace because of its connection with Kerala’s largest pilgrim center Sabarimala. 

    Located on the lap of the majestic Western Ghats, Perunthenaruvi adorns herself with her ever gorgeous waterfalls and the mystic lush forest glides that wrap her in their serene arms.  Kudamurutty and Vechoochira are the two shores of the waterfall.

        Visitors to Pathanamthitta district are never really sure of what to expect from Aranmula. This is mostly due to the lore surrounding this exotic village, famous for the genius of its craftsmen and the ancient vibe one experiences the moment oneenters. Aranmula is famous for its Aranmula Kannadi (metal mirrors), the centuries’ old Sree Krishna Temple, the unique ritualistic feast of `Vallasadya,’ and famed Aranmula Boat Race and the list goes on.

It gets its name from the centuries-old Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple (dedicated to Sree Krishna) on the banks of the holy River Pamba, a virtual hotbed of devotees. The murals, carvings and paintings here have inspired much awe and interest. It is also the venue for the Aranmula Vallasadya, a ritual offering to the deity Lord Parthasarathy in which the oarsmen of the snake boats are offered a feast. With over 70 dishes it is probably one of the largest vegetarian feasts in India.

        Its legendary Vijnana Kalavedi houses some of the finest classes and teachers for a variety of art forms like Kathakali, classical dances, classical music and Kalaripayattu. Visitors can stay here for an extended period and observe the ancient crafts being passed on diligently to the next generation. 

        A trip is never complete without obtaining one of its special metal mirrors- the beautiful Aranmula Kannadi. From being gorgeous souvenirs to exquisite wedding gifts, these are unique to this locale and haven't yet been replicated anywhere else in the world.
