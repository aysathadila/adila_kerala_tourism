    Largest and most famous of all Poorams, the Thrissur Pooram is held at the Vadukkannathan Swamy temple of Kerala every year in April - May. This annual Hindu temple festival of Kerala is held for a week in the month of Medam according to the Malayalam calendar. It was first held during the reign of Raja Ravi Varma, the Maharaja of Cochin and popularly known as Sakthan Thampuran. A unity of 10 temples that are ordained as two groups namely Thiruvambady and Paramekkavu, brings a large festivity to life with a display of innovative fireworks and elephant caparisons. Being considered as the largest festival in Asia that's secular in nature, Thrissur Pooram is a festival that's a must see.
   </p>
   <p>
    The temple-festival falls in the month of Medam of the traditional Malayali calendar, on the day when Pooram star witnesses the rising moon. Being observed according to the Malayalam calendar, which is varied from the Christian calendar, the dates for the observance of the festival varies each year regarding dates and months of the commonly followed Christian calendar. Though the month of Medam generally falls in April or May, it is still a task for the worshippers to look for dates, just like Muslims before observing the festival of Eid, before deliberating for attending the festival.
